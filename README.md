Source code of the _live coding_ session from [Mobile Sites Certification StudyJam 2018](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/GDG-Torino/events/246096224/) held by GDG Torino.

An example of PWA scaffolding built with Polymer 2.0 on top of Polymer starter kit.

### Features

- PRPL architectural pattern
- App Shell Model
- Dynamic content loading (GDG Torino's events fetched using the Meetup API)
- Service Worker
- Web App Manifest

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli

Second, install [Bower](https://bower.io/) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

    npm install -g bower

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8081` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve
